// the 8 primitive types in Java are: boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float & double


// make sure not to change the area of a file, if you need to 
//println prints a string than terminates the line

//publc within the brackets is the access modifier
	//	static is a keyword that allows us to find our method to run the code
	//	void signifies that the method 'main' will not return any information


// Java programs like other languages have keywords/ Each has a specific meaning and sometimes they need to be used in a specific order.
//Java is written using a specific set of rules

// Public, public, and PUBLIC are all considered different keywords

// Public and class are keywords.
// The public Java keyword is an access modifier. An access modifier allows us to define the scope or how other parts of your 
//code can access this code. 
//Public is an access modifier to give full access. 

// the class keyword is used to define a class with the name of the class following the class keyword
// class Hello for example
// Hello is the name of the class that when coupled with {}, defines the class block.
