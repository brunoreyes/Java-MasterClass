initial test

Maven uses a project object model (POM)which is an XML file that has all the info regarding
to a project and it's configuration details. 

When we try to execute a task, Maven searches for the POM in the current directory.

Maven is a build tool that helps with project management and building out and documenting a project.

Maven is written in Java and C# and is based on POM, used mainly to manage Java-based projects.


Maven is chiefly used for Java based projects because it downloads dependencies like libraries or JAR files

Maven gets the right JAR files for each project. To find dependencies I can go to: mvnrepository.com
